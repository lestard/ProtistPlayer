# ProtistPlayer
ProtistPlayer will be a cross platform desktop music player. It focuses on user defined playlists and uses tabs to visualize playlists.

The software is based on mozilla's XUL and is developed in JavaScript.

## Goals
+ cross platform support
+ media management based on tabs and playlists instead of a media library
+ customizable global shortcuts
+ "playback follows cursor" / "cursor follows playback" like in foobar 2000
+ probably an additional version as firefox addon

## Licence
ProtistPlayer is licenced under the GPLv3 licence
